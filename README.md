This Psychopy experiment is a human replication of the [mouse visual decision-making task developed by IBL](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc8137147/).

The most recent and up to date version is "WIN_cursor_ibl.psyexp". This version was designed to run on Windows using Psychopy v.2021.2.3. The experiment can be opened and edited on later versions and on Mac, but note that on a Mac, the mouse component will not allow to click "continue" buttons due to the retina screen doubling the mouse coordinates.
