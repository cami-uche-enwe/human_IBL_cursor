This Psychopy experiment is a human replication of the mouse visual decision-making task developed by IBL.

The most recent and up to date version is `WIN_cursor_ibl.psyexp`. This version was designed to run on Windows using Psychopy v.2024.1.4. The experiment can be opened and edited on later versions and on Mac, but note that on a Mac, the mouse component will not allow to click "continue" buttons due to the retina screen doubling the mouse coordinates.
